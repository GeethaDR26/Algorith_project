# Algorith_project
A Java-based implementation of basic search and sorting algorithms with a menu-driven console interface.



# Algorithm_Project

This repository contains Java implementations of fundamental **searching and sorting algorithms**, including:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search (with auto-sorting check)
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

A **menu-driven program** allows users to interactively choose operations and observe sorted output or search results. Ideal for students revising DSA fundamentals or Java learners practicing with arrays and algorithm logic.
